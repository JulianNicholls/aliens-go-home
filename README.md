## Re-factoring

I hgave re-factored a great deal of it after I completed reading the articles. 
The tag 'Part-3-complete' reflects the state at the end of the articles.

## Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for 10 years.
Over that time, I have tried many different graphical shells for Git,
without finding one that was easier and nicer to use than the command-line
(in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
